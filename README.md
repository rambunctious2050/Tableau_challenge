## Using public Citi Bike data logs, I analyzed data in the 3 month period of February-April in 2019 and 2020 to uncover trends of how the COVID-19 pandemic changed Citi Bike usage in NYC.
### Used Pandas (Python) to clean the data and generate final data files
### Created graphics in Tableau using these final data files, published here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/ramyata.upmaka#!/
### The full set of Tableau graphs and charts are saved in the "CitiBike_Tableau_Charts_FullDeck.pptx" deck
